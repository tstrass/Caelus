A weather app for iPhone that focuses on the hourly forecast.

I built this app while interning at Enterprise Holdings, Inc., in order to further my skills as an iOS developer, and to improve my understanding of the process of mobile app development from conception to production.

All weather data is from the [Weather Underground API](http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/).

Note: this app is built only to run on an iPhone with a 4" screen.
